see ChangeLog for more information

version 0.7.23 (development)
=====================================
2005-07-11

* Add libvcdinfo vcdinfo_get_area_selection() a routine to get the 
  selection number represented by an area for a specified a point
  location
* Add libvcdinfo vcdinfo_get_set_resolution() a routine to get the 
  resolution for a given segment
* hack on memory leaks some more
* vcdxrip options more like vcd-info options
* check that selection area hot-spot values don't exceed 255. 
* Update documentation
* Remove gcc 4 warnings and potential problems noted
* make --disable-static --enable-shared work with --versioned-libs

version 0.7.22 (development)
=====================================
2005-05-14

* vcdxrip: add option "notrack" to skip ripping of a specific track
* vcd-info: single argument acts like -i option
* some stylistic coding changes (e.g. add _t suffix and p_ prefix)
* fix clobbering a version number via strncpy
* Add libvcdinfo example program
* Memory leaks and errors reduced

version 0.7.21 (development)
=====================================
2004-12-08

* release number is now preprocessor symbol so applications can make use of
  for compatibility
* More libcdio things moved into libcdio (e.g. MSF printing, 
  iso9660 PVD handling)
* use generic list things from libcdio. Eventually everything will
  use glib. But this moves in the right direction by consolidating code 
  a little

  LSNs to greatly reduce the number of CD reads when there are many
  files in the ISO-9660 track, or there are many segments or continued
  segments. Requires libcdio 0.65 API change.
* API completion: (libvcdinfo) now has API for multi-default selections;
  APIs for mapping a selection number to a LID or LID offset added.

* cdxa2mpeg warns if input and output file are the same.
